        Hey! 👋 I'm Ben, nice to meet you! I'm an honors
        undergraduate studying computer science in the beautiful,
        sunny campus of Arizona State University. I've been building
        software for several years now, and my experience includes
        full-stack and low-level development, in such languages
        as <code>Python</code>, <code>Javascript</code>, <code>Typescript</code>
        and <code>C</code>. Check out my website's <a class="anchor"

        Much of my previous work laid in web development, but I'm
        looking to sharpen my skills in systems programming, data
        science, and machine learning.

        I'm always excited for new opportunities to learn, grow, and
        best of all, build. Refer to my social profiles linked on my
