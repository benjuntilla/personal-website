      // Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ben, nice to meet you! I'm an honors
      undergraduate studying computer science in the beautiful, sunny
      campus of Arizona State University. I've been building software
      for several years now, and my experience includes full-stack and
      low-level development, in such languages as <code>Python</code>,
      <code>Javascript</code>, <code>Typescript</code>
      and <code>C</code>. Check out my website's <a class="anchor"

      looking to sharpen my skills in systems programming, data
      science, and machine learning.
